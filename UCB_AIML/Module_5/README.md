# Summary of findings

## Overall coupon acceptance rate is 57% so this approach is clearly effective.

## Drivers who frequent bars more than once a month had a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons. This suggests that they are more receptive to offers related to bars and are more likely to visit a bar given an incentive.

## There was a higher acceptance rate among drivers over the age of 25. This could be related to lifestyle, social habits, or established preferences for bar environments among this demographic.

## Drivers who did not have children as passengers showed a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons. This is likely due to the perceived appropriateness or social norms associated with taking children to bars. Drivers might be less inclined to redeem a bar coupon if they have children in the car.

## While not as strong of a correlation, there's a slight indication that drivers in occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry were more likely to accept bar coupons.

# Independent analysis shows that drivers who frequent coffe houses have a nearly ~70% acceptance rate. 

## Coffee house coupon rate acceptance is highest in the morning hours. 
## Coffee house coupon rate acceptance is highest when drivers were not heading to work or home.
## Carry out and Take away has the highest acceptance rate ~75% followed by Restaurants(<20) ~70%
